<font face="" size=""><b>2.</b> Start by finely chopping your onion. You can also use shallots for this, I mainly grab whatever I find in my pantry. Do the same with the ham. I’ve used fresh and vibrant organic/biological tomatoes for this and I must say, there’s definitely a noticeable difference in flavor. I was always skeptical about it, but it’s just really a deeper and more pure flavor. Hard to describe. Anyway, give them a rough chop. Remove as many of the seeds as you can but don’t sweat it, most of the seeds will fall off when you transfer them to the skillet later on.</font><br>

My ramekins don’t look great with all the gray on white (especially not in photos), but they do have a huge advantage to them – a non stick interior, so I’ll gladly trade in pretty pictures for comfort. Spoon the vegetable mix in whatever you’re gonna use to bake it in and top with a little grated cheese.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>[3]</b> </font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>5.</b> Just crack an egg over each baking dish. Now there’s a slight chance one (or all) of your eggs survived the crash, so we’ll just have to burst their bubbles ourselves. If you leave the yolk intact it’s gonna end up all dried out, small, sad and shriveled up. So use something sharp to break the yolk and let it run its course. Don’t mix things.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>[4]</b> </font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>6.</b> Pop them in a preheated oven for about 15 minutes and keep an eye on them. If after 15 minutes the egg white doesn’t look completely firm give it a few more minutes. You want the egg to be fully cooked but the yolk underneath still a bit soft and runny.</font><br>

<font face="" size=""><b>2.</b> There are so many ways to roast peppers, but my favorite way is to simply char it on my stove top. When it’s blackened enough, put it in a plastic bag (or glass bowl and cover with foil) and leave it there for a while. The skin will come off real easy that way.</font><br>

<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>4. </b>Start by mincing the shallots. Really fine, there should be no large chunks (of anything) floating in your sauce. Sautee the shallots in the butter. I’ve used margarine – it’s equally fat but contains less saturated fats than real butter. Go with whatever you prefer, though.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>5. </b>Once the onions are translucent, put the flour in there and stir until it’s smooth. Don’t leave the stove now because it only takes a split moment for the roux to burn and you’ll be starting all over again. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes while whisking now and then, this will neutralize the rawness of the flour. I always use this whisk when making a sauce that can absolutely contain no lumps. They’re only 50 cents at Ikea, so I have tons of them.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>[3]</b> </font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>6.</b> After roughly 2 to 3 minutes you can add the milk. Now everyone has their own way -I know one of the most common ways is to slowly add milk (or broth) and stir, pour more milk in and stir- but I don’t do it like that. I just pour in one cup and then I stir. Somehow it just works better for me that way.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>7.</b> Add salt and pepper to taste. I went for 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp white pepper, and whisked as if my life depended on it! Now add the Parmesan, stir until it’s all melted and smooth. Taste to see if it needs a bit more Parmesan, with me it always does.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>8.</b> Now for my favorite part: turning this pristine, white mornay into something with a bit more color. Grab the pesto rosso and add two heaping tbsp. I’m truly pathetic, I just get a real kick out of seeing the color change. Always keep tasting what you prepare, so check the seasoning and adjust if you have to. This is such a rich sauce, the flavors are amazing. I swear, I just boil the pasta to have something to eat this sauce with because it would look bad, real bad, if I would just spoon it out of the pan.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>[4]</b> </font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>9.</b> The pasta will be done by now. Drain it, and pour a teeny bit of olive oil over it and toss it around. This will prevent the pasta from sticking together and forming a rather unhappy looking dough clump. Some say you can also add the oil to the water when you boil the pasta, but that doesn’t work for me. I think they’re all lying because it can not possibly be my fault that it doesn’t work :)</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""><b>10.</b> Take the skin off the bell pepper and cut in small strips. Grab that pretty dish/bowl/platter and put the pasta in. Lightly coat it with the sauce and just play with the ingredients. Make it look fun and pretty. Garnish with some basil leaves and Parmesan curls. Serve with a little extra grated Parmesan and olive slices on the side.</font>

The secret to this is getting the texture of the pork mince right. To achieve the small granules of fried pork and therefore a larger surface to which the spices can stick, ‘mash’ the pork with a balloon whisk during frying to break it down into small chunks. It’s that easy!
If you are concerned about the amount of oil used in this recipe, place the finished mince mixture in a large sieve over a bowl and let the oil drain away.

Shape into a mounded loaf, (some people cut a deep cross in the top) and bake in a preheated oven, 200 c / 400 F, for 25 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 180 c / 375 f and cook a further 10 - 15 minutes until done. The loaf should be a light golden brown colour and sound hollow when tapped.

If you are "game" try cooking it on a camp fire; nothing beats that extra smoky flavour, especially using Australian Eucalyptus wood to give it that special something. If you are cooking in an oven at home, try putting a few Gum Leaves in the over to smoke as your are cooking the bread.

Damper is very similar to Irish Soda Bread, and probably developed from recipes brought over by Irish immigrants/convicts.

Variations of the basic recipe are seemingly endless, but you could try substituting other liquids, such as beer for a darker colour/flavour, or varying the ratio of milk to water, and so on. Try adding more sugar and butter and some dried fruits for a dessert damper. Basically use your imagination.

If you are cooking on an open fire you could try wrapping the dough in aluminium foil before you place it in the coals, or even try wrapping the dough around a stick and cooking suspended over the flames.

In a large measuring cup or bowl whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla extract.

In another large bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the chocolate chips. With a rubber spatula fold the wet ingredients, along with the melted butter, into the dry ingredients and stir only until the ingredients are combined. Do not over mix the batter or tough muffins will result.

Evenly fill the muffin cups with the batter (the muffin cups will be full), using two spoons or an ice cream scoop. Place in the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for about 5 minutes before removing from pan.

Chocolate Frosting: Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.

In the bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy (about 1 minute). Add the sugar and beat until it is light and fluffy (about 2 minutes). Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the chocolate and beat on low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until frosting is smooth and glossy (about 2 -3 minutes). Spread a little frosting on each muffin with a knife or offset spatula.

To Make Hollandaise: Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.

Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.

Preheat oven on broiler setting. To Poach Eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water, and allow to cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate

While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.

Carefully done, and perfectly flavored, it is certainly one of the most delicious beef dishes concocted by man, and can well be the main course for a buffet dinner. Fortunately you can prepare it completely ahead, even a day in advance, and it only gains in flavor when reheated. 

Vegetable and Wine Suggestions
Boiled potatoes are traditionally served with this dish. Buttered noodles or steamed rice may be substituted. If you also wish a green vegetable, buttered peas would be your best choice. Serve with the beef a fairly full-bodied, young red wine, such as Beaujolais, Côtes du Rhône, Bordeaux-St. Émilion, or Burgundy.',NULL,'2011-11-23-22-27-57-106-3990214',NULL,'Serves 6');

Position racks in top and bottom third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Coat two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Line bottoms with parchment paper rounds; spray rounds. Sift flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into large bowl; whisk to blend and form well in center. Whisk 1 cup water, buttermilk, oil, and eggs in medium bowl to blend. Pour wet ingredients into well in dry ingredients; whisk just to blend. Divide cake batter between prepared pans (about 3 cups each).<br>
<br>
Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. (If cakes form domes, place kitchen towel atop hot cakes, then press gently with palm of hand to level.) Cool completely in pans on cooling racks. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover cakes in pans and let stand at room temperature.<br>
<br>
<b>For chocolate ganache and raspberry topping: </b><br>
Place chopped chocolate in medium bowl. Bring cream just to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Pour over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then stir until ganache is melted and smooth. Transfer 1 1/4 cups ganache to small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ganache is thick enough to spread, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Let remaining ganache stand at room temperature to cool until barely lukewarm.<br>
<br>
Place rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Carefully run knife around pan edges to release cakes. Invert 1 cake layer onto cardboard round or bottom of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Peel off parchment paper. Place cake layer on round on prepared rack. Spread 3 tablespoons jam over top. Spoon dollops of chilled ganache over, then spread evenly. Invert second cake layer onto another cardboard round or tart pan bottom. Peel off parchment paper. Carefully slide cake off round and onto frosted cake layer on rack. Spread remaining 3 tablespoons raspberry jam over top of second cake layer. Pour half of barely lukewarm ganache over cake, spreading over sides to cover. Freeze until ganache sets, about 30 minutes. Pour remaining ganache over cake, allowing to drip down sides and spreading over sides if needed for even coverage and to smooth edges. Freeze to set ganache, about 30 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover with cake dome and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before continuing.<br>
<br>
Arrange raspberries in concentric circles atop cake. Sift powdered sugar lightly over raspberries and serve.

Beating too much will dilute the cinnamon too much. This is where the cinnamon quantity comes in. You want it to look like the batter picture above, where there are still clearly some fair sized bits of yolk floating around in there, along with the clumps of cinnamon. You HAVE to be able to see those bits of cinnamon. If you have to, add a few more bits of cinnamon. In my experience, with french toast, it''s very hard to have too much cinnamon.

Once the batter is ready, pour into a wide flattish dish for bread dunking. For brioche, you''ll find you need something of a goodly size. You don''t want to be bending the bread to get it in or out, otherwise it can fall apart quite easily. I use a glass pie pan, but a foil one would obviously work as well.

Slice the brioche nice and thick -- about 2cm. You''ll want it to be hefty enough to hold itself together when it''s full of batter, but not so thick that it doesn''t cook through.

Then, the easy part: cook! I cook each slice on it''s own. It''s just easier that way. Dunk the slice in the batter, then, fairly quickly -- this will take some experimentation! -- turn it over, and then pop it straight into a hot buttered frypan (I use about medium heat on our gas stove). You don''t want your pieces of french toast to be TOO soggy. Think of it like dunking cookies; wet, but not so wet that the cookie breaks off and winds up at the bottom of the glass of milk. An overdunked slice is a BITCH to turn, and winds up being soggy in the middle. Blurgh. Cook them as dark as you''d like them, or until they look a lot like medium dark toast (see pic!). Serve, with maple syrup (NOT maple FLAVORED syrup) and fruit, and revel in the complements!

2. For the carrot cake: beat the eggs in a large bowl, then add the oil, brown sugar, grated carrot, raisins and chopped nuts. 

3. Sift in the rest of the dry ingredients and bring the mixture together using a wooden or large metal spoon until well combined. 

4. Pour the mixture into the prepared loaf tin, smooth the surface and bake in the oven for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. 

5. Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool in the tin for about five minutes before removing. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. 

6. For the icing: beat the cream cheese and butter together in a bowl until well combined. Add the vanilla extract, icing sugar and finely grated orange zest and mix until the icing is smooth and thick. Using a palette knife, spread the icing evenly over the cooled cake, dipping the knife into a bowl of hot water if the icing is hard to spread out. Cut into slices to serve. 

Cook’s note: Instead of using jam for the filling, why not try lemon curd or melted chocolate? Alternatively, spread the sponge with raspberry or blueberry cream. Un-iced, this cake is also delicious sliced and buttered. ',NULL,'','(

Butter and flour the cake pan. Set the chocolate and rum or coffee in a small pan, cover, and place (off heat) in a larger pan of almost simmering water; let melt while you proceed with the recipe. Measure out the rest of the ingredients. 

Cream the butter and 2/3 cup of sugar together for several minutes until they form a pale yellow, fluffy mixture. Beat in the egg yolks until well blended. 

Beat the egg whites and salt in a separate bowl until soft peaks are formed; sprinkle 1 Tbsp. sugar and beat until stiff peaks are formed. 

With a rubber spatula, blend the melted chocolate into the butter and sugar mixture, then stir in the almonds, and almond extract. Immediately stir in one fourth of the beaten egg whites to lighten the batter. Delicately fold in a third of the remaining whites and when partially blended, sift on one third of the flour and continue folding. Alternate rapidly with more egg whites and more flour until all egg whites and flour are incorporated. 

Turn the batter into the cake pan, pushing the batter up to its rim with a rubber spatula. Bake in middle level of preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Cake is done when it has puffed, and 2 1/2 to 3 inches around the circumference are set so that a needle plunged into that area comes out clean; the center should move slightly if the pan is shaken, and a needle comes out oily. 

Allow cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan, and reverse cake on the rack. Allow it to cool for an hour or two; it must be thoroughly cold if it is to be iced. 

To serve: Use the Chocolate-Butter Icing, and press a design of almonds over the icing.',NULL,'','(

Pull the paper over the top of the log. Grip the edge of the top piece of paper, and use a straight, firm edge, like a ruler or the edge of a pan, to press gently against the edge of the dough where the papers come together to create a solid, firm round log. Repeat with remaining dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (To keep logs round store inside an empty paper towel roll.)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Slice logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds with a sharp, thin knife. Divide rounds onto the prepared sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

Bake until cookies smell fragrant with a full cocoa aroma and set on the outside, about 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the pans, about 5 minutes.

Transfer cookies to a rack to cool completely. Serve.

Busy baker''s tips: Dough can be made and frozen for up to 2 weeks. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Baked cookies can be wrapped in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil and frozen for up to 2 weeks.

Cook''s note: For super uniform cookies, place each sliced disk of dough in a muffin tin and bake. The cookies will be chewier, less sandy this way.',NULL,'1 hour 20 minutes','(

Pulse the almonds in a food processor until finely chopped, but not pasty. Stir together the nuts, flour, zest and salt in a large bowl.

Put the sugar, cream, corn syrup and butter in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a rolling boil and sugar is completely dissolved. Continue to boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, then pour mixture into almond mixture and stir just to combine. Set aside until cool enough to handle, 30 minutes.

Scoop rounded teaspoons (for 3-inch cookies) or rounded tablespoons (for 6-inch cookies) of batter and roll into balls. Place on prepared baking sheet, leaving about 3 to 4 inches between each cookie since they spread.

Bake 1 pan at a time, until the cookies are thin and an even golden brown color throughout, rotating pans halfway through baking time, about 10 to 11 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve.

Optional chocolate topping: 
Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very low simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue heat until completely melted, about 1 to 2 minutes more.)

For sandwiches: Drop about 1/2 teaspoon chocolate onto on the flat side of half of the cookies and press together with remaining halves. Return to rack and let chocolate set.

For chocolate decor: Drizzle melted chocolate over Florentines as desired. Set aside at room temperature until chocolate is set.

Would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and I got exceptional results. So moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o) Depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it. I was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over again!!

<font face="" size="">If using fresh ricotta that has excess liquid, you may need to drain it overnight. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set it over a medium bowl. Add ricotta; cover with plastic wrap and let drain overnight in refrigerator. If using supermarket ricotta, proceed with recipe; no draining required.</font><br>

<font face="" size="">Gently mix ricotta, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, egg, Parmesan, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl just to blend (do not overwork). Form dough into a ball (it will be sticky); wrap in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 4 equal portions and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Using your hands, roll 1 portion into a 1/2"-diameter rope; cut crosswise into 1/2"-thick pieces. Lightly dust gnocchi with flour and transfer to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining portions of dough. Cover gnocchi with a kitchen towel and chill until ready to cook. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 months ahead.

<font face="" size="">For chicken and gravy: </font><br>
<font face="" size="">Bring broth to a boil in a large saucepan. Add chicken; reduce heat to low, cover, and gently simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 2030 minutes.

<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Scrape roux into simmering broth; whisk until thickened and broth coats the back of a spoon. Reduce heat to low and add vegetables. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill, uncovered, until cold; cover and keep chilled. Rewarm before serving.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Cook gnocchi in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until gnocchi float to the surface, about 2 minutes (slightly longer if frozen). Using a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to bowls, dividing equally. Ladle chicken and vegetables with gravy over. Season with pepper and top with Parmesan.</font><br>

Pour one cup of water into the bottom of a small pot.

Stir in protein powder until all the lumps are gone, and bring the water to a boil.

Stir in oats and turn heat down to medium or medium-high. Stir in almond butter.

You don’t have to stir constantly, but do stir frequently and watch for boil-over. In time you will learn what heat setting is right for your stove.

Once the oatmeal starts to look a little bit dry, add a little bit more water and stir it in. Some low-fat milk, if you need to add a block to your breakfast, also makes it creamier.

Keep stirring every few minutes and adding water as needed, for about 15 minutes (shorter if you like crunchy oats, longer if you like them smoother).

Sprinkle on spices and Splenda to taste. Add a dash of natural vanilla extract, or another flavor that you prefer.

Whisk the whole wheat flour, cornstarch, ginger, salt and baking soda together in a medium bowl. Whisk in the oat/nut mixture.

In another medium bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until smooth and light, about 1 minute. Gradually add the granulated and light brown sugar; continue beating until evenly combined, about 3 minutes more. Add the vanilla and the egg.

Mix in the dry ingredients to make a textured dough. Line a 1 1/2-quart loaf pan or 3 mini loaf pans with plastic wrap and pack dough into the bottom half of the pan. Press to level off the dough. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top and refrigerate until completely firm, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.

Remove dough from the pan and unwrap. Slice dough in half lengthwise if using a large pan. Slice each log crosswise into 1/4-inch thick cookies. Place the cookies about a 1-inch apart on the prepared pans. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool and crisp. Serve.

For the filling : 

Cream the pumpkin pie filling and sugar together in a blender. Add the whole 12 oz. tub of tofu, I will usually pat the outside of the tofu with a paper towel so it''s not as  wet and then I''ll cut the tofu into cubes before placing it into the blender. This makes the tofu blend and mix easier.  Add the salt, spices, and vanilla.  Soy milk is optional. I tend to use 1/4 cup of soy milk if the filling is too thick to blend. 

Continue mixing all of the ingredients until the consistency is smooth. Now you are ready to make the crust if you''re making it from scratch.  You may use a pre-made pie crust shell if you desire.  If you already have a crust, continue reading, if you are making a crust from scratch, look below. 

Put the filling into the crust and bake for 15 minutes at 425℉ and then turn the heat down to 350℉, continue to bake for an additional 35 minutes until pie is done. You then  can chill and serve.  

 
Making crust :

Measure flour and salt into bowl.  Cut in shortening thoroughly.  Sprinkle in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until all flour is moistened and dough almost cleans side of the bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons water can be added if needed).

Gather dough into ball; shape into flattened round on lightly floured cloth-covered board.  With floured stockinet-covered rolling pin, roll dough 2 inches larger than inverted pie pan.

It is similar to a lemon filling or custard in that it is cooked on the stove. But instead of cooking the lemon curd in a saucepan, we are going to put it in a stainless steel bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water (can use a double boiler). This method does take a little longer, but it helps prevent the eggs from curdling (little specks of cooked egg). Just make sure that the water in the bottom saucepan is ''simmering'' which is defined as the point just short of a boil, that is, when bubbles start to appear. Oftentimes if you find the lemon curd is not thickening fast enough, all you need to do is increase the temperature of the simmering water. Once the lemon curd has become nice and thick (like hollandaise), remove it from the heat and strain to remove any lumps that may have formed. Then stir in the butter and lemon zest and you''re done. Cover immediately with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate. You will find that the lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools. It will keep in the refrigerator for about a week. You can even make the lemon curd lighter in texture and flavor by folding in a little whipped cream once the curd has been thoroughly chilled.

When choosing lemons look for ones that are fragrant with brightly colored oily yellow skins. The best ones are firm, plump, and heavy for their size. Don''t buy lemons that have blemishes, soft spots, or are hard and wrinkled. Lemons consist of a yellow outer rind (skin) that can be of varying thickness and graininess, and can have either a bumpy or a smooth texture. This outer skin is where most of the lemon''s wonderful tangy flavor is located. Before removing the outer rind (zest) make sure you wash the lemon thoroughly (soap and water is best). When removing the zest do not remove the white membrane (pith) that is underneath as it is very bitter tasting. Once you have removed the outer rind, inside the lemon are small vessels called ''pulp vesicles'' which contain the pleasantly acidic lemon juice and seeds. Squeezing the lemon by hand or with a lemon squeezer or reamer releases this clear tart juice. Always use fresh lemons to make lemon curd as the bottled lemon juice is a poor substitute and won''t give you that wonderful sharp and refreshing citrus taste.

 

In a stainless steel bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and lemon juice until blended. Cook, stirring constantly (to prevent it from curdling), until the mixture becomes thick (like sour cream or a hollandaise sauce) (160 degrees F or 71 degrees C). This will take approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately pour through a fine strainer to remove any lumps. Cut the butter into small pieces and whisk into the mixture until the butter has melted. Add the lemon zest and let cool. The lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Cov

Cut slits in the crust with a sharp knife, forming steam vents, and bake the pie in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F. and bake the pie for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until the crust is golden. Let the pie cool on a rack and serve it warm at room temperature.</font><br>

)','Christmas',NULL,'Peppermint Bark',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'It''s funny how something can go unnoticed for years and then suddenly you see it everywhere. That is how it was for me this year with Peppermint Bark; that beautiful confection composed of two layers of chocolate, one dark one white, that are topped with crushed candy canes.

The only problem I have with commercially made Peppermint Bark is that it is very expensive. Luckily we can make it at home as it is much easier to make than it looks. Only three ingredients (dark and white chocolate and candy canes) and a little vegetable oil are required. The difference between commercially made Peppermint Bark and homemade is how the chocolate is handled. Commercially made Peppermint Bark uses tempered chocolate which keeps the chocolate shiny and hard, even when stored at room temperature. Since most of us are a little hesitant about tempering, this recipe omits that step. Instead, a little vegetable oil is added to the melted chocolate which will keep it nice and shiny, and it will still have that wonderful ''snap'' when you break it into pieces. The only difference is that since the chocolate isn''t tempered, homemade Peppermint Bark needs to be stored in the refrigerator.

If you have spent any time on the site you know I often talk about how the brand of chocolate you use will affect the flavor of what you are making. So, as always, choose your chocolate carefully. There are many good brands of dark and white chocolate on the market, both foreign and domestic. Just be sure to taste the chocolate first as not all chocolates are the same. Some popular brands of dark chocolate are: Ghirardelli, Guittard, Lindt, Perugina, Scharffen Berger, Callebaut, and Valrhona. When choosing white chocolate, always check the label to make sure the chocolate contains cocoa butter. White chocolate needs cocoa butter to give it that sweet yet mellow flavor and smooth and creamy texture. Inferior brands use vegetable fat in place of the cocoa butter and their flavor ends up being very sweet and artificial tasting. Good brands of white chocolate are Lindt and Callebaut and even Baker''s (found in grocery stores).

Put the butter and the unsweetened and semisweet chocolates in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 75 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir and heat again until melted, up to 2 minutes more. (Alternatively, put the chocolates and butter in a heatproof bowl.

Stir the light brown and granulated sugars and vanilla into the chocolate mixture with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and buttermilk and beat vigorously until thick and glossy.

In another bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, cinnamon and salt together. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until just mixed. Stir in chocolate chunks and dried cherries, if using.

Drop the batter in heaping tablespoons onto baking sheets--a small ice cream scoop is ideal for this. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart. Bake until the cookies set but are soft and fudgy on the inside, 12 to 15 minutes.

1 Cut chicken breast into 1 inch strips or bite size pieces.

2 Heat a large non-stick skillet that has been sprayed with Pam, over medium-high heat.

3 Cook chicken for about 6 minutes or until no longer pink.

4 Mix together honey, soy sauce, water, corn starch, ginger and red pepper flakes.

5 Whisk until no corn starch lumps appear.

6 Pour sauce mixture into skillet with chicken.

7 Cook until sauce thickens slightly.

8 You can add more water if sauce is too thick.

9 Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

10 Cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until chicken starts to soak up the sauce.

11 Note: Since originally posting this recipe, I have tried some of the suggestions others have made. I do like it with a bit of sesame oil (be careful not to get too much, just a few drops at the end of cooking is good enough for me, but you might like more), fresh ginger is also good if you have it on hand. I have tried it with garlic and it is good that way also. I have also found that it is good with shrimp and pork. Basically what I am trying to say is, the orginal recipe is just a simple, quick and healthy meal I came up with when I was craving Chinese food. I thought it turned out really great and wanted to share it. I''m happy that so many of you have enjoyed it.

 3. Divide batter evenly among prepared ramekins. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool completely. Run a knife around sides of cakes; unmold. Cakes can be refrigerated, wrapped in plastic, up to 1 day.

 4. Trim each cake to 1 inch high. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cut eight 10 3/4-by-4-inch strips of parchment paper. Wrap a parchment collar around base of each cake, keeping bottom flush with baking sheet. Secure each collar with tape; set aside.

 5. Transfer bittersweet-chocolate mousse to a large pastry bag fitted with a large round tip (such as Ateco #808). Pipe a 1-inch layer of mousse into each parchment collar. Refrigerate until mousse is set, about 20 minutes. Repeat with milk chocolate mousse, piping on top of the bittersweet chocolate mousse. Refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to overnight.

Whisk the flour and salt together in a bowl.

In another medium bowl, rub the citrus zests into the sugar with your fingers until the sugar is fragrant and takes on a bit of the fruit color. Beat the eggs into the sugar with a wooden spoon until blended. Stir in the flour mixture to make a smooth, sticky but pourable batter. Stir in the pistachios. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the surface lightly with a spatula.

Bake until the loaf is lightly browned and pulling away from the sides of the pan, about 40 to 45 minutes. A skewer inserted into the center should come out clean, and the loaf will look like a not so great pound cake. Let stand for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool on a rack for 1 hour.

Wrap the loaf in plastic and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Slice the chilled loaf as thin as you can — 6 to 8 slices to the inch. (It helps to mark the loaf lightly with a serrated knife every half-inch and use that as a guide.) Lay the slices flat on 2 baking sheets and bake until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Take care — the cookies can go from pale to dark brown quickly.)

Let stand overnight or for at least 12 hours on a rack to cool and crisp up. Serve. Store in a well-sealed jar or other container.

Busy baker''s tips: The loaf can be stored well-wrapped at room temperature for a week, or frozen for a month. The melbas are best stored in an airtight container, away from moist cookies and cakes. Freeze slices double-wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 1 month. Defrost in their wrappers.',NULL,'12 hours','(

Whisk the flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl.

In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer, beat the butter with the sugar on medium, until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Turn mixer to low speed, add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not over work the dough. 

Transfer dough to prepared pan, spreading it out evenly across the pan and pressing to make a 1/4-inch thick covering over the bottom of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap, then press and flatten using your hands over the top to smooth and even out the dough. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Remove the plastic from the top of the dough and prick the dough with a fork or a wooden skewer. Bake the crust until just golden, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the jelly in the microwave until soft enough to spread, about 1 minute. Spread the jelly with a pastry brush or an offset spatula over the crust. Return to the oven and cook another 10 minutes. Cool crust completely on a wire rack, 1 hour.

Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, yolks, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, flour, and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat until thick and slightly pale. Stir in the citrus juices and zest, and whisk gently to blend well.

Pour the filling onto the cooled crust and bake until the filling is firm but still loose and wobbly in the center, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight before cutting.

Remove bars from refrigerator and dip the bottom of it in warm water to soften the butter and release the foil from the sides of the pan. Use foil to lift pastry out of the baking pan and transfer to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut into about 50 1 1/2-inch squares, wiping down the knife with a hot, wet towel between cuts.

In a large frying pan heat about ½ cm of olive oil.  When it''s very hot add the potatoes from the bowl and start to fry them.  Be sure to keep stirring them so that they don''t stick or start to brown.  
 
After about 5 minutes add half an onion to the potatoes.  This should be chopped very fine.  Stir the contents of the frying pan then cover it.

Now break 8 large eggs into a bowl and add a pinch of salt and beat them.

Keep checking the frying pan to be sure that the potatoes aren''t turning brown.  Turn down the heat if necessary.

Keep stirring (Montse says "keep moving them" as the Spanish verb to stir is "mover"!).

Once the potatoes break easily under the touch of the stirring spoon they are ready.  So now add the potato/onion mix to the bowl of beaten eggs.  Drain away any excess that''s left in the frying pan oil at this point.

Mix the potato and egg mixtures together well whilst the frying pan gets very hot with no extra oil in it.

Now add the mix to the frying pan.

Flatten it down in the pan and keep the heat at medium for a few minutes. 

Put a plate over the mix and turn over the tortilla gently.  When you return it to the pan press down the sides to create the classic shape of tortilla de patatas. 

Turn the tortilla several times.  You''ll find it gets heavier each turn.  

It is ready when you put a knife into it and the knife comes out clean.

This recipe makes a vary large omelette. What I tend to do is create the same mixture as above but make two separate tortillas using a smaller pan as this seems more manageable. Be sure to use a ladle when transferring the mixture to the frying pan if you decide to follow this advice otherwise one omelette ends up with too much liquid and the other with too much potato.

Melt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter browns lightly and smells slightly nutty, about 15 minutes. Transfer the butter to a medium bowl -- be sure to get all the tasty brown bits -- and cool slightly.

Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another medium bowl.

Whisk the egg yolk, sugar and vanilla into the cooled browned butter.

Stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture to make a uniform but crumbly dough that looks like wet sand.

Scoop out dough with a small teaspoon (the kind you set the table with, not the ones you measure with). Rock spoon gently back and forth against the side of the bowl, packing the dough into the spoon, then scrape/slide the spoon against the inside of the bowl to make spoon-shaped cookies. Trim excess dough with your fingers and slide out onto the prepared pans, preserving their shape. (Try to make sure you form an even number of cookies, since these sandwich together.)

Bake cookies until just browned, about 12 to 15 minutes. Cool almost completely on the baking sheets, and then transfer cookies to a rack to cool.

When cool, spread 1/2 teaspoon jam on the flat side of a cookie, and then sandwich together with a second cookie. Repeat until all cookies have met their match. Lightly dust the cookies with the confectioners'' sugar. Serve.

Busy baker''s tips: The dough can be prepared several hours ahead and stored at room temperature. Freeze baked cookie halves wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, followed by aluminum foil for up to 2 weeks. When ready to serve, defrost at room temperature and assemble as desired. Store sandwiches in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Do not store with crisp cookies, as moisture from the jam will soften the texture of other crisp cookies.',NULL,'30 minutes','(

Bake until it is well browned, but the center still jiggles when you shake the pan.  45 to 47 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool, about 30 minutes.  Cut into squares and serve.

To make the filling: Puree the filling ingredients in a food processor until evenly combined, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set aside. Clean the processor bowl.

Put the flour, baking powder, the 1 tablespoon confectioners'' sugar, and salt in the bowl of food processor and pulse 3 to 4 times to mix. Add the butter, oil, and milk pulsing until the dough just comes together. Take care not to overwork the dough; it will be slightly wet.

Remove dough from the processor, and roll into 20 equally sized balls. In the palm of your hand, press and pat each ball of dough into a 2 3/4-inch round. Place a rounded teaspoon of filling in the center of each round and draw the edges up and around the filling. Pinch the dough together to make a sealed ball, and then carefully roll the cookie between your palms to make a smooth round ball. Press gently to flatten the cookie slightly, then place them seamed side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Gently prick the cookies with a fork or a wooden skewer in a decorative pattern taking care not to pierce the dough to the filling.

Bake the cookies until firm and slightly puffed, and the tops are pale but the bottoms are just beginning to turn slightly golden, about 25 to 30 minutes. Dust generously with confectioners'' sugar, cool and dust again.

In another medium bowl, briskly whisk the eggs, sugar and melted butter together until smooth and evenly combined.

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg mixture. Gradually whisk the liquid into the flour to make a thick batter. When the pizzelle batter starts to clump up in the whisk, switch to a rubber spatula to finish mixing it together. (If you have a large pastry bag, put a big round tip in it, and fill with the pizzelle batter.)

Preheat a pizzelle iron until a drop of water sizzles on the hot surface, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray the hot surface with nonstick cooking spray. Pipe or spoon about a tablespoon of the batter into the center of each cookie imprint. Close the iron and cook until whiffs of steam comes from the iron, about 30 to 45 seconds. Open and remove cookie from the iron, cool on a rack. Repeat with remaining batter.

To make the filling: 
Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave safe bowl. Cover and microwave on medium power until soft and melted, about 3 minutes depending on the power of your oven; stir until smooth. Alternatively, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1-inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan (without touching the water). Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Stir in mint extract.

To serve pipe a tablespoon of the mint filling into the center of half the cookies. Top with another cookie and press to sandwich them together. Serve now or keep tightly covered for up to 1 week. ',NULL,'','(

For the cookie: Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl.

Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl, with an electric mixer, at medium-high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and add the egg and vanilla extract. Beat well, and then scrape down the sides.

While mixing on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 batches. Scrape down the bowl between each addition, and mix until just blended.

Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake until light golden brown with spots of darker golden brown and darker edges, about 30 minutes. Cool completely, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the fruit: Whisk the cornstarch and sugar together in a small saucepan. Whisk in orange juice until mixture dissolves. Stir in the fruits and candied orange peel. Bring to a simmer over medium, stirring often; continue to cook, stirring until thickened into a compote, about 3 minutes more. You should be able to draw the spoon along the bottom of pan and see the pan with no liquid seeping back. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Stir in the nuts and lemon zest.

Spread fruit evenly over the top of the cooled crust.

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake mazurkas until golden brown around edges and fruit sets but is still slightly glossy and jewel-like, about 10 minutes. Cool in pan on rack.

Cut, using an oiled knife, into 24 bars. Serve.

Busy baker''s tips: When double-wrapped, the cookie base keeps at room temperature for 3 days or frozen for 1 month. The fruit compote can be made up to 1 week ahead and refrigerated.

Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, pepper and mustard together in a medium bowl.

Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until just combined and lightly fluffy. Beat in the molasses and egg yolk. Gradually add the dry ingredients and mix together on low speed until dough is just combined and still crumbly, about 3 minutes. Give dough a few turns with a spatula to bring together.

Lay out wax paper on a clean work surface and put about 1/3 of the batter on top. Lightly press down and top with another sheet of wax paper. Using your hands or a rolling pin, gently pat into a rectangle. Roll out with a rolling pin until dough is as thin as possible without breaking, no thicker than 1/16 inch thick. This is the key to these cookies: they really can''t be too thin. Gently peel back the layer of waxed paper and then replace it loosely.

Transfer rolled batter to a flat baking sheet and freeze until firm and can easily be peeled away from the waxed paper, about 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Cut dough using a small (2- to 3-inch) fluted round cookie cutter and return to the freezer for 15 minutes to set. Transfer frozen cookies to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake until crisp and lightly, evenly colored (but not brown), about 10 minutes.

Busy baker''s tips: Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 10 days. The dough can be frozen, between sheets of waxed paper and well-wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 weeks. Baked cookies can be wrapped in plastic wrap then aluminum foil and frozen for up to 1 month.

Cook''s note: Don''t be intimidated by how many cookies this recipe makes. This dough freezes well, and you can roll out far in advance -- so when you need cookies, you can cut and bake as needed, which is a great holiday timesaver.

Make the Crumb: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, wisk together the flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon.

Melt the butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and almond extracts. Gradually drizzle the melted butter mixture into the flour mixture while continuously and gently tossing with a fork. Continue to toss until all the butter is absorbed and you have a uniformly moistened crumb mixture. If texture of crumb is too small, gently squeeze small clumps together to make large crumbs ranging in size from that of a pea to that of a grape, about 1/4- to 1/2-inch in size. (Adding the butter too fast and/or over-mixing can result in the crumb mixture coming together as a solid dough. If that happens, simply use your fingers to break-up the solid crumb mixture into big crumbs, about 1/4- to 1/2-inch in size. Crumbs don''t have to be uniform, just try to get most about this size.) Set aside while you make the cake batter.

Make the Batter: In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in the vanilla and sour cream, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder. Add flour mixture to the sour cream mixture and beat on low or stir with a large spoon until evenly combined.

Turn the batter into the prepared pan(s) and spread evenly. Sprinkle the crumb mixture over the batter with your fingers, covering the batter evenly and completely. Bake 8-inch rounds for 20-25 minutes, or a 9-by-13-inch pan for 30-35 minutes, or a 9- or 10-inch tube pan for 35-40 minutes. Cake is done when a wooden pick or cake tester inserted near the center comes out clean, and the sides of the cake are golden and slightly pulling away from the edge of the pan.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Stir together walnuts, butter, and salt.

Roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 14- by 12-inch rectangle. Cut out 40 rounds with lightly floured cookie cutter and discard trimmings.

Brush tops of rounds with egg wash, then sprinkle each with about 1/4 teaspoon walnut mixture and transfer to a parchment-lined large baking sheet. Bake rounds in middle of oven until golden and puffed, 10 to 15 minutes, then slide pastries on parchment onto a rack to cool. (Leave oven on.)

While pastries are still warm, gently pull each one apart to make a top and a bottom. Lightly press down any puffed inner layers on tops and bottoms if necessary.

Make filling while pastry bakes:  Mash together cheese and toasted walnuts with a fork.

Fill pastries:  Sandwich a 1/2-teaspoon mound of cheese filling inside each pastry (between top and bottom), then bake in middle of oven on parchment-lined baking sheet (it''s not necessary to use a clean sheet of parchment) until cheese begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Season tops of pastries with pepper and serve immediately.

Cooks'' notes:  • Puff pastry can be baked and rounds separated into tops and bottoms 1 day ahead, then cooled completely and kept at room temperature in an airtight container.  • Pastries can be filled (but not baked) 1 hour ahead and kept, loosely covered, at room temperature.

If you are making the stuffing ahead: Transfer the cooked vegetable mixture to a large bowl. Let cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for 24 hours. Mix with bread cubes before stuffing the bird.

Stuff the turkey at both ends with this mixture. (see our Roast Turkey Recipe for directions on stuffing the bird). IMPORTANT: Stuff the turkey just before baking it.

Variations:


Add 1 cup fresh chopped parsley for extra fresh herb flavor.

Replace 1 cup of the celery with a cup of chopped fennel. Fennel has a mild licorice flavor that will add a bit of a twist to our traditional turkey stuffing.

A delicious addition! Add 1 to 2 cups of chopped fruit to the mix. Chopped apples, chopped dried apricots, raisins, currants or blueberries (yes, blueberries) are all amazing added to herbed turkey stuffing. Try it once and you''ll be hooked.',NULL,'','(

Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. 

Whisk the buttermilk and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup. Set aside.

Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat at high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, alternating with the wet in 2 parts, beginning and ending with the dry to make a smooth batter.

Evenly mound 2 tablespoons batter per cookie onto the prepared cookie sheets, spacing them about 2-inches apart. (A small cookie scoop or ice cream scoop is ideal for this.) Bake until the cookies are golden brown around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool completely.

For the chocolate icing: Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan; pour over the chocolate. Shake the bowl gently so cream settles around the chocolate; set aside until the chocolate melts, about 5 minutes. Whisk until smooth, taking care not to incorporate too many air bubbles. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small tip with about half of the chocolate icing.

For the white icing: Whisk the confectioners'' sugar, corn syrup, lemon juice and warm water together to make a smooth icing. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small tip with about a quarter of the icing.

To Decorate: 

For tuxedo cookies: Set the cookies on a rack over a rimmed cookie sheet. Pour the white glaze over the whole cookie to cover; set aside to dry. Pipe a bowtie and tuxedo lapel with the chocolate icing.

For a little black dress and pearls: Pipe an outline of a woman''s dress with the dark chocolate and fill in with more icing. Pipe white icing pearls around the top of the cookie. Add silver dragees or candy pearls to dress up, if desired.

Let cookies dry completely, about 20 minutes. Serve.

Lightly press to smooth and seal the doughs together. Remove the top parchment.

Trim the edges on the layered doughs with a pizza cutter using a ruler or other straight edge as a guide. Working with the short edge facing you, cut the layered dough in half vertically. Set 1 piece on top of the other and then turn the dough, to have the long side facing you. Cut the dough in half again and set 1 piece on top of the other.

Grind 1 cup of the confectioners'' sugar, the hazelnuts, and cocoa in a food processor until powdery, about 3 minutes. Sift mixture through a medium mesh strainer onto a piece of parchment paper, then discard any large pieces of nuts that didn''t come through the strainer.

With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and salt until they hold firm but not dry peaks, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the remaining 1 cup confectioners'' sugar, a tablespoon at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed; this can take up to 3 minutes. Beat for an extra 30 seconds until the peaks are firm and shiny but still not dry. Fold the nut mixture gently into the egg whites with a large rubber spatula. Transfer mixture into a large piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain piping tip. Pipe 32 2-inch by about 1/3-inch thick rounds, evenly spaced, on each of the prepared pans. Set aside to air dry for 30 minutes before baking.

Meanwhile make the filling: Put chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream, with espresso powder mixed in, to a boil. Pour cream over chocolate and shake bowl gently so cream settles around the chocolate. Set mixture aside until the chocolate is soft, about 5 minutes. Whisk gently until smooth, taking care not to incorporate too many air bubbles. Cool at room temperature until set up.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Bake macaroons until set and puffed, about 18 to 20 minutes. Take care not to overcook the macaroons or they''ll crack. Cool cookies for 5 minutes then gently peel from paper. Let cool completely.

Core the apples and, with a sharp knife, cut a line round as if circling the equator. Put them in a roasting tin. Press in butter and sugar, alternately, in the holes and press any excess on top.

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (130 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and draw a 7 inch (18 cm) circle on the paper.

In the bowl of your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until they hold soft peaks. Start adding the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat until the meringue holds very stiff peaks. (Test to see if the sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a little of the meringue between your thumb and index finger. The meringue should feel smooth, not gritty. If it feels gritty the sugar has not fully dissolved so keep beating until it feels smooth between your fingers). Sprinkle the vinegar and cornstarch over the top of the meringue and, with a rubber spatula, fold in.

Gently spread the meringue inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper, smoothing the edges, making sure the edges of the meringue are slightly higher than the center. (You want a slight well in the center of the meringue to place the whipped cream and fruit.)

Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes or until the outside is dry and takes on a very pale cream color. Turn the oven off, leave the door slightly ajar, and let the meringue cool completely in the oven. (The outside of the meringue will feel firm to the touch, if gently pressed, but as it cools you will get a little cracking and you will see that the inside is soft and marshmallowy.) 

The cooled meringue can be made and stored in a cool dry place, in an airtight container, for a few days. 

Just before serving gently place the meringue onto a serving plate. Whip the cream in your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, until soft peaks form. Sweeten with the sugar and vanilla and then mound the softly whipped cream into the center of the meringue. Arrange the fruit randomly, or in a decorative pattern, on top of the cream. Serve immediately as this dessert does not hold for more than a few hours.

The Pavlova can be made several days in advance of serving, if it is stored in a cool dry place, in an airtight container. A Pavlova is usually served with softly whipped cream and fresh fruit. (For a lower fat dessert, instead of whipped cream, try serving the Pavlova with a sorbet or fruit sauce (Raspberry, Blueberry, or Strawberry would be nice) and fresh fruit.) Because of the sweetness of the meringue I like to offset the sweetness with tart flavored fruits. Passion fruit, kiwi, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries are some of my personal favorites. Try to place the whipped cream and fruit on the meringue shortly before serving as the meringue will immediately start to soften and break down from the moisture of the cream and fruit.

For the cookie: Put the butter in a heatproof medium bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer over medium-low heat. Set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. Once the butter is melted, add the sugar and cocoa, and stir to combine. Add the egg and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, until warm to the touch and slightly thickened (it should be about the consistency of hot fudge), about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in graham crumbs, coconut and nuts. Press the dough firmly into the prepared pan. (Save the pan of water for melting the chocolate.)

For the filling: Beat the butter, peanut butter and confectioners'' sugar together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light. Spread over the cookie and freeze while you prepare the chocolate glaze.

For the glaze: Put the chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl, and set over the barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. (Alternatively, put the chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more.). When cool but still runny, pour the chocolate layer over the chilled peanut butter layer and carefully smooth out with an offset spatula. Freeze 30 minutes.

To serve, remove from the freezer and let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes. Pull out of the pan using the foil flaps and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 1-inch squares with a sharp knife. Serve cool or at room temperature.

Combine the self-raising flour and caster sugar in a medium bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. To help incorporate some air into the mixture, keep the palms of your hands face-up as you lift the flour to rub in the butter. This will help make the scones lighter in texture. I have found that room-temperature butter gives a better result than chilled butter in scones. It is also easier to incorporate into the flour when at room temperature. Butter helps give the scones a tender texture as well as adding flavour.

Add the milk all at once. Use a round- bladed knife to mix together using a cutting motion until evenly incorporated and the mixture begins to hold together. Do not over mix. Again, I have found that room-temperature milk is better to use in scones than milk straight from the fridge. The flour mixture needs less mixing to incorporate the room-temperature milk evenly, resulting in a lighter texture. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it is a little dry, simply add a little more milk. Then bring dough together with your hands.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently about 4-5 times with your hands, by pressing and then turning, until the dough is just smooth. It is important that you knead gently and don''t handle the dough too much. If it is overworked, gluten in the flour will develop which will cause the scones to be tough in texture and heavy.

Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out the dough until about 2cm thick. (Alternatively, you can flatten the dough with the palm of your hand). Then use a round 5cm pastry cutter to cut out the scones. Dip the cutter into the extra flour before cutting out each scone. Use a straight-down motion to cut out the scones. Do not twist the cutter as this will cause the scones to rise unevenly during cooking. You can re-roll any scraps and cut more scones; however, these will be slightly less tender than the scones cut from the original dough and will rise less evenly.

As you cut out the scones, place them on a baking tray about 1cm apart. Placing them this close together will also help them rise evenly. I have found there is no need to grease or flour the tray. Sprinkle the tops of the scones with a little extra flour. Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden and cooked through. The best way to tell if the scones are cooked is to tap the top of one with your fingertips - if it sounds hollow when tapped, they are ready. Alternatively, insert a skewer into a scone - if it comes out clean, they are ready.

Remove the scones from the oven and immediately wrap them in a clean tea towel. Wrapping the scones will keep them warm and will give them a soft crust. Serve warm with lashings of butter or with jam and whipped or thick cream.',NULL,'','(

)','Christmas',NULL,'Nanaimo Bars',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'Nanaimo Bars (or N.B.s for short) are one of Canada''s favorite confections. The beautiful City of Nanaimo, British Columbia lays claim to these squares, telling us on their website that it all began when a Nanaimo housewife entered a recipe for chocolate squares in a magazine contest some 35 years ago. She called her recipe ''Nanaimo Bars'' and when she won the contest, not only did her dessert become popular throughout Canada, so did the town they were named after. These no-bake, three layered bars are delicious; they start with a crumb base, followed by a layer of light custard buttercream, topped with a smooth layer of chocolate.


There are many different recipes for these squares. In fact, when the City of Nanaimo ran a contest back in 1986 to find the ''ultimate'' Nanaimo Bar, there were about 100 recipes submitted. All Nanaimo Bars begin with a base layer, a combination of cocoa powder, chopped nuts, coconut and graham cracker crumbs held together with melted butter. Once this mixture is pressed into a square pan and chilled it is then covered with a rich layer of buttercream made of butter, powdered sugar, custard powder, and a little milk. An important part of this buttercream is the dried custard powder, which was the invention of an Englishman, named Alfred Bird. He invented this powder because his wife loved homemade custard but was allergic to eggs. Alan Davidson in his "The Oxford Companion to Food" tells us that this powder is not, in fact, a dried form of real custard but is just cornflour (cornstarch) and sugar that has been colored and flavored. When the dried custard powder is used in this buttercream it adds a lovely flavor and it also turns the cream a soft peach color. Now, if you live in the States, custard powder is not readily available. I have found it in specialty food stores (Bird''s Custard Powder is the most popular brand) or online, but if you are unable to find it, just substitute it with an equal amount of instant vanilla pudding. .

The finishing touch to these squares is a coating of shiny semisweet chocolate that provides a slight crunch as you bite into them. For this recipe, because chocolate is one of the more dominant flavors, make sure to use a good quality chocolate that you enjoy eating out-of-hand. When choosing a chocolate, always look for one that has a lovely shiny finish (a sign that the chocolate was cooked at the right temperature for the right amount of time) and one that has that wonderful ''snap'' when you break it into pieces. Once the melted chocolate is poured over the buttercream layer and has been left to set, cut the squares with a sharp knife that has been dipped in hot water and then wiped off.

Add 4 cups of hot water and chicken broth to the tomato and onion. 

Let boil. 

In frying pan, fry rice until browned. 

Once it is browned you will add it to the hot water mixture you just made. 

CAUTION: Lower heat to simmering on the water mixture so that it 

does not boil over and make a mess when you are slowly adding the hot 

fried rice.  Once you add the fried rice, stir ONCE and cover to cook.   

Whalah!!!!!  You have just made yourself authentic spanish rice!   

NOTE: If you have ever tasted rich spanish rice...the secret is to add 

a couple pads of butter to the top of the rice when it is done.  This is 

optional. 

One other thing that we do in Mexico that may sound strange but is very 

delicious is that we add sliced bananas to the top of our rice when it is 

done.  This is extremely tasty.  Children especially love it!!! ',NULL,'','(

Notes & tips

Makes: the equivalent of 3 sheets (25 x 25cm) ready-rolled puff pastry

Prep: 30 mins (+ 2 hours resting time)

Lard is rendered animal fat and is available in the dairy section of your supermarket, near the butter.

Top tips:

When making puff pastry, both the ingredients and the equipment should be as cool as possible.

Chill dough between folding so the butter doesn''t melt into the dough and the layers remain separate.

Use a short, quick rolling action so the butter is gradually and evenly distributed between the layers.

Roll lightly so the butter doesn''t tear the layers and break through.

The pastry should be chilled and rested before cooking and the oven must be hot so the pastry puffs before the butter melts and runs out.

When cutting and trimming pastry, use a sharp knife that cuts quickly and easily without draggin',NULL,'2 hours','(

<b>2. </b>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Place bread on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake bread until almost dry throughout (center should remain slightly moist), about 16 minutes, flipping slices halfway through cooking. Remove bread from rack and let cool 5 minutes. Return baking sheet with wire rack to oven and reduce temperature to 200 degrees.<br>

<b>3. </b>Whisk milk, yolks, sugar, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons melted butter, salt, vanilla, and rum in large bowl until well blended. Transfer mixture to 13- by 9-inch baking pan.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> Soak bread in milk mixture until saturated but not falling apart, 20 seconds per side. Using firm slotted spatula, pick up bread slice and allow excess milk mixture to drip off; repeat with remaining slices. Place soaked bread on another baking sheet or platter. Sprinkle each slice of soaked bread with 1 tablespoon nut mixture.<br>
<br>
<b>5.</b> Heat ½ tablespoon butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. When foaming subsides, use slotted spatula to transfer 2 slices soaked bread to skillet—nut mixture side down—and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes longer. (If toast is cooking too quickly, reduce temperature slightly.) Transfer to baking sheet in oven. Wipe out skillet with paper towels. Repeat cooking with remaining bread, 2 pieces at a time, adding ½ tablespoon of butter for each batch. Serve warm, passing maple syrup separately. <br>
<br>
<b>Keys to Perfect French Toast</b><br>
<b>START WITH DRY BREAD:</b> Drying bread in 300-degree oven before soaking and frying leads to toast that’s soft, not soggy.<br>
<b>HOLD THE WHITES:</b> Using yolks, not whites, in soaking liquid cuts down on eggy flavor. <br>
<b>SOAK PROPERLY:</b> Soaking bread in flat baking pan for just 20 seconds per side ensures even saturation and no sogginess.<br>

Toast the walnuts until golden brown and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Let cool, then chop about half of the nuts (you should have about 1/2 cup chopped). Pulse the remaining nuts in the food processor until finely ground (about 1/4 cup ground).

Stir the flour, baking powder, salt and nuts together in a medium bowl. Set aside.

In another medium bowl, beat the butter, sugar, egg yolk, brandy and vanilla extract together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture gets light and fluffy, about 10 minutes.

At low speed, stir in the nut mixture to make a crumbly dough. Cover the bowl and set dough aside at room temperature for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or coat with nonstick spray.

With a tablespoon, scoop out 1-inch pieces of dough and roll into balls between the palms of your hands. Pinch the ends of the balls to make a football shape. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies set and start to brown, about 18 minutes.

Remove cookies from the oven and immediately sprinkle them lightly with the orange water. (If you don''t have a brush, simply dip your fingers into the water and flick it over the cookies a few times.) Take care not to douse them, just enough for them to carry the scent of flowers.

Put the confectioners'' sugar in a bag, and add 5 to 6 of the warm cookies to it. Very gently toss the cookies to coat with sugar. Remove them from the bag and cool cookies on a rack. Repeat with remaining cookies. Serve.

Busy baker''s tips: Dough can be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Baked cookies can be wrapped in plastic, then aluminum foil, for up to 2 weeks. To serve, let cookies come to room temperature before dusting with confectioners'' sugar.

Beat the butter and the sugars with a hand mixer or electric mixer on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and beat on medium speed until just incorporated, about 20 seconds. Add the molasses and ginger preserves and continue beating until the batter is an even light brown color, 30 seconds more.

Add the dry ingredients all at once, beating slowly to make a soft, smooth dough. Use a rubber spatula to make sure all ingredients are combined. Then beat again for 20 seconds. Cover the bowl with plastic and refrigerate the dough until firm, about 25 minutes.

Put about 1/2 cup sugar in a small bowl. With a cookie scoop or a small ice cream scoop, portion the dough into a slightly heaping tablespoon for each cookie. Roll the dough, by hand, into balls. Roll the tops of the balls in the sugar, and space them 2 inches apart on a nonstick or lightly oiled cookie sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 25 minutes.

Put 1/2 cup of the sifted confectioners'' sugar, 10 ounces (3 heaping cups) of the almonds and all the cinnamon in a food processor. Process until the nuts are finely ground, with just a few larger pieces.

Whip the egg whites in a large, clean bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until they hold soft peaks, about 1 minute. Gradually add the remaining confectioners'' sugar while whipping, until the whites are thick, creamy and somewhat stiff, about 2 minutes more. Set aside 2/3 cup of this meringue for topping the cookies.

Fold the ground almond mixture and the lemon zest into the remaining meringue to make a stiff dough.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

Lay a sheet of parchment or waxed paper on the work surface and lightly dust with confectioners'' sugar. Turn the dough out onto the dusted paper, flatten and dust with more sugar as needed, and then lay another sheet of parchment or waxed paper on top. Roll the dough between the papers until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Flip the dough over and gently peel off a sheet of the paper. For ease when cutting, lay the paper back on the dough, flip again and gently pull off the other side of the paper so that the dough is fully released from it.

Cut cookies with a 3-inch star cutter and place about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. (Excess dough can be rerolled.) Use a small spoon, brush or offset spatula to spread the reserved meringue over the top of each cookie, taking care not to let the meringue drip over the sides. Press or sprinkle remaining sliced almonds in a decorative pattern into the meringue.

Bake cookies until bottoms are light golden brown and meringue is set and crisp, about 30 minutes. Turn off the oven and open the oven door to release heat and dry cookies out in the oven for 10 more minutes.

Busy baker''s tips: The dough can be frozen between the sheets of paper for up to 2 weeks. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 10 days.

*Cook''s Note: the amount of confectioners'' sugar is correct in this recipe. The voice over on the video is incorrect. Use 1/2 cup with the almonds and 1 3/4 cups with the egg whites.

Pulse the nuts in a food processor to finely chop, allowing some larger pieces of nuts to remain. In a large bowl, combine butter, almonds, flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of the milk. Add the extract. Drizzle yolk mixture over almond mixture and toss with fingers to combine and get everything moistened. (If needed add up to 1 more tablespoon of milk.) Mixture should still be crumbly, but not dry, like a crisp topping.

Sprinkle 1 cup (about half of the crumbs) on the prepared baking sheet and press lightly to create a thin, even 8-inch round. Sprinkle remaining crumbs over the top to give the cookie some texture. Bake until golden brown and crisp, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking, about 30 minutes. For an extra crispy cookie, turn oven off at this point and let the pan rest in oven for 10 minutes.

Cool on a rack until easy to handle. Slip the fregolata on the paper onto a rack to cool completely. When cool, sift confectioners'' sugar over top.

To serve, place a whole almond or overturned demitasse spoon under the center of the fregolata and rap the top with a spoon or the side of a knife to crack into serving pieces.

Busy baker''s tips: Dough can be frozen on cookie sheet for up to 1 week and baked from the freezer (for an extra 5 to 10 minutes). Store baked cookie in an airtight container or on a baking sheet wrapped with plastic wrap for up to 1 week.

In a large bowl combine all dry ingredients together. Mix them thoroughly.

Preparing the tofu: If you cannot find an 6 oz. block of tofu, just cut a 12 oz. block in half. To get the consistency correct, squish the tofu through your fingers to mash it up. Once the tofu is thoroughly mashed you can then add it into the mixture.  You just want the tofu to be smaller. You dont want it to be in big chucks. If it''s in big chunks it''ll make it harder to mix the batter and you may have chunks in the final baking. 

After the dry ingredients are mixed well, combine the wet ingredients. Mix the ingredients all together and mix them well. You want the consistency to be smooth, it will be grainy because of the cornmeal. You just want to make sure there are no big tofu chunks or any clumps of flour etc. 

Next you want to pour the batter into a well greased or sprayed 8-inch square baking pan / dish. You can grease the pan with soy margin or a "PAM" equivalent, just make sure it''s vegan friendly.  You will want to bake the bread for 25 minutes.  

Once it''s done you may cut and enjoy.

Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

For rolled cookies: Roll about a tablespoon of dough by hand into a ball. Dip 1 side of the balls into some coarse sugar and place them sugar-side-up on an ungreased baking sheet, leaving about 1-inch between cookies.

For sliced cookies: Divide dough in half, roll by hand into 2-inch-wide logs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.

Cut the logs into 1/4-inch-thick cookies and place them on ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies.

For cutout cookies: Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.

Roll dough between lightly floured parchment, or waxed paper, until about 1/3-inch thick. Transfer sheets to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, place them on ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. (Gather the dough scraps together, pat into a disk, chill and reroll.) 

Refrigerate cookies while preheating the oven to 375 degrees F, for at least 30 minutes. 
Bake the cookies, until the bottoms are golden, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.

Combine all the ingredients, except the food coloring, in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix slowly until stiff enough to form peaks. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is overbeaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting.

Alternatively, combine ingredients in a large bowl, and beat with hand beaters on low speed until the frosting thickens to stiff peaks.

Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. (Adding too much color reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days.) Store icing, covered, with plastic film on the surface of the icing.

In a large sauce pan Melt butter.  Temperature needs only to be hot enough to cook onions. 

Add yellow onions and garlic and sauté till onions are clear.  (do not caramelize onions)

Add bell peppers, celery, parsley, Crawfish Tails and Green Onions.

Add water to keep mixture wet as it cooks.  Keep stirring as needed.  Using the bag the crawfish came in to add water will
help transport any flavor left from the crawfish. 

When Crawfish are cooked mix Flour into about a cup of room temperature water. Pour this slowly into mixture as you stir.
This is the point where the sauce is starting to develop.  Add water and cook down as needed.

Time to season dish.  (THIS IS A SEASON TO TASTE ITEM) First sample sauce.  Then add Paprika, black pepper and McCormick''s Season-All.  Cook a few minutes
then taste to determine if more Season-All/black pepper needs to be added.  

Salt is the most important ingredient.  It is added last. Some people won''t add any since the Season-All has some. Crawfish tails vary in quality even from the same vendors. Some times more salt helps draw the flavor from a weak batch of crawfish.


When flavor is to your liking add water or cook sauce down to a thick sauce that will stick to the rice. 

Serve over rice with a piece of french bread.  It can be placed in a bowl or on a plate.

**********************************************************************************************************************


Information to help you with your dish:

*Crawfish can be bought at most U.S.A. grocery stores in the frozen seafood areas. It comes in 1 pound packs.
* Benecol and Promise  are great butter replacements and are great for your health.  They help lower cholesterol and do not hurt the dishes flavor.
*McCormick''s Season-All  is  MSG Free. The seasoning balance saves one from owning lots of spices.
*Rice cookers can be bought for about $20.00.  The $60.00 and up models can keep cooked rice fresh for a few days.
*Using a wooden spoon to stir is traditional but the new silicon stirring spatula works better.
*A teflon coated pan with curved edges is preferred. The Silicon spatula  works great in these. Lots of meals can be cooked quick and easy with little clean-up effort using these two tools.
*Serve using a nylon spoon if meal is served from the pan.
*Garlic powder can be used to replace the clove. (Do not use garlic salt.)
*Some people place the chopped green onions uncooked sprinkled over the dish for looks and flavor.
* The the Etoufée can be placed over the rice or some put the Etoufée in a plate then put a ball of rice in the center of it.
*If an extra side dish is desired look into making Mustard Potato Salad. This is a traditional side.

Beat the butter and lemon zest with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Slowly beat in the egg yolk and cream.

Whisk the flour, pecorino, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, sugar, rosemary, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Gradually add the flour mixture into the butter mixture while mixing slowly. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on medium speed to make a slightly sticky dough.

Fill the cookie press with the dough. Assemble the press with the desired disk shape (see cook''s note), and press cookies onto ungreased baking sheets. Leave about one inch between cookies. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan and refrigerate cookies for 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Cook''s Notes: These freeze beautifully. Press the cookies out into desired shapes on cookie sheets and freeze. Transfer frozen cookies to a plastic bag, seal, and keep frozen for up to 1 month. When ready to bake, lay out frozen cookies on cookie trays and bake from frozen for 25 minutes.

If you don''t have a double boiler, improvise one by using a saucepan and a stainless steel bowl: Nestle the bowl into the saucepan, allowing a few inches of space to remain between the bottom of the bowl and the bottom of the saucepan. Keep an extra bowl of a similar size on hand to transfer the chocolate for cooling. Rest the chocolate thermometer on a towel. Line a baking sheet with foil.

Pour a couple inches of water into the bottom half of the double boiler and heat over medium-low to just below a simmer. Put the chocolate in the top half of the double boiler and set over the hot water. Slowly melt the chocolate, stirring with a heat-resistant rubber spatula. As the chocolate melts, check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 82 and 86 degrees F. If it starts to rise above this temperature, quickly transfer the chocolate to the bowl on reserve and stir briskly to reduce heat. Return bowl to double boiler to maintain heat between 82 and 86 degrees F.

Remove bowl from over the hot water just before all the chocolate melts. Stir vigorously until the chocolate melts completely. Check temperature again. Stir in the oil until evenly blended. Chocolate is now tempered and ready to use. Keep within the 82 to 86 degree F range, returning bowl briefly to the double boiler if necessary.

Quickly stir the fruit and nuts into the chocolate. Spread chocolate mixture out on the prepared baking sheet so it''s about 1/2-inch thick and the fruit and nuts are coated. Set bark aside at room temperature to harden. Break into angled pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Blend and pulse the 1/2 cup nuts in a food processor with the sugar until mixture resembles coarse sand. (If there are a couple small chunks of nuts that is fine.) Add the butter, vanilla and almond extracts, and the salt, and pulse until creamy. Add the flour and continue to pulse to make a soft dough.

Turn the dough out into a 9-inch tart pan and spread it out evenly with an off-set spatula. Dip the spatula in a little warm water to help smooth and even the surface of the shortbread. Cover and freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.

Put the tart pan on a baking sheet and dock (prick) the dough all over with a fork. Generously sprinkle the top of the shortbread with sugar.

Place the sauce pan on medium heat and warm the milk just below the boiling point (the milk will start to form bubbles on the edges of the pan and it will become steamy just before it boils.)<br>
<br>
Remove the sauce pan from the heat and stir just a couple of tablespoons of the hot milk into the eggs and sugar mixing well the whole time. Then gradually add the rest of the milk, stirring the whole time. Return the mixture to the sauce pan and place on low medium heat.<br>
<br>
Heat the sauce until it thickens, but do not boil or the yolks will curdle. The sauce is done when it stays on the wooden spoon without dripping (this takes about five minute, but will depend upon your pan and burner). You can run your finger on the back of the wooden spoon and if the track remains without drips, the sauce is done.<br>
<br>
As soon as the sauce is thickened, immediately remove from the heat. Pour the sauce into a heat resistant bowl (you can pour the sauce through a strainer to remove the vanilla bean and any clumps). Stir in the vanilla extract if that is what you are using, then cover the sauce with plastic wrap, placing the wrap right on top of the sauce. Refrigerate to desired serving temperature.

The curd is the lumpy white mass, the whey is the yellow/greenish liquid. Once the curd has completely separated, drain off the whey, retaining the curd, using a strainer or a sieve lined with a white cotton/muslin cloth (cheesecloth). Run some cold water on the curd to cool it down.

Save the whey, as it has some nutritional value and can be used when preparing soups or lentils.

Remove any remaining whey from the curd by pressing it with the back of a spoon. Tie up the curd in the cheesecloth and hang up the bundle so it can drip for 2 to 3 hours. Placing a bowl underneath to catch the drips of whey is a good idea. At this stage,the curd can be referred to as ''paneer''.

Gently flatten the paneer, still wrapped up loosely in the cloth, to make a patty shape. Put it on a plate and put a heavy weight on it. Tilt the plate to one side, so that any whey which is squeezed out can drain off. Leave for four or five hours. Cut into cubes of desired size.

If you are using the paneer – or in this case, the chenna - to make sweet desserts, you do not need to flatten it. The chenna is ready to be used after the dripping stage.

Paneer, unlike other cheeses, has not been matured and is rather bland. If you keep it refrigerated it will last for 5 to 5 days. You can also freeze it for about a month - but once it has defrosted don''t freeze it again.

My tip: Freeze the paneer in cubes and portioned into a plastic freezer bag.',NULL,'','(

Place ground beef in a large bowl and add eggs, onions, crackers, salt, pepper and sage. Mix well. Using your hands works best to get the ingredients well mixed.

Divide meat into four portions and shape into steaks. Typically Salisbury steak patties are made oval instead of round; however, round is fine. Just don’t make them too thick, or they’re hard to cook through.

Cook the meat patties on both sides until browned and cooked through. Then, set the patties aside.

Pour off hamburger grease and wipe inside of pan.

Directions for the Gravy:

Add butter to the skillet where the patties were cooked and let butter melt.

Pour drained mushroom slices into hot butter and cook for two minutes stirring.

Add flour and mix well. A fork or a whisk works well for getting the flour mixed in.

Add water and bouillon cubes. Cook on medium until the sauce thickens up.

If you like a darker colored gravy, you can add Kitchen Bouquet or other browning ingredient to the gravy. This is only for eye appeal and not required.

Place the cooked Salisbury steaks back in the gravy and turn heat to low. Let simmer on low for around 10 minutes.

Alternatively cut the dough into long strips with a pizza wheel or knife, and place them on the filling in a lattice pattern; or cut the dough into ovals and lay them on the filling in a decorative pattern. Brush decorative layer of dough with egg white.

Using the filling portion (''the bumpy side") of a 12-section ravioli mold, cover the indented side with plastic wrap. Pack some of the filling into each indentation, leveling each one so it''s flush with the top of the mold. Remove and place on a plate. Repeat to make 24 fillings. Cover the filling with plastic wrap and refrigerate. (Eat the crumbs left behind.) 

To make the dough: Combine the butter and sugars in a large mixing bowl. Beat at medium speed, until fluffy and combined, about 2 minutes. Add the molasses and vanilla and beat until combined. 

In a separate bowl, whisk both flours, the baking soda, salt and cinnamon together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 parts, alternating with cream in 2 parts, beginning and ending with flour. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Divide into 2 disks, wrap in plastic warp and chill until very firm, about 1 hour. 

Lay out an 11 by 15-inch piece of foil on a clean workspace and sprinkle generously with flour. Place a disk of dough on top and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the dough between the two layers (Voila, no messy hands) until you have a rectangle measuring 10 by 13 inches, cutting and patching as needed. Repeat with the other disk of dough. Transfer each foil to a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 

When chilled, remove plastic wrap from 1 flat of chilled and rolled dough. Spray the zigzag side of the ravioli mold with nonstick spray and sprinkle it with flour. Place the mold, zigzag side down, onto the lower half of the dough, making a slight indent in the dough. Take the chocolate filling from the refrigerator. Place a round of filling on the center of each square ravioli impression. 

Using the foil to lift the top of the dough, fold it over the mounds on the bottom half leaving plenty of give to tuck dough between each mound. Gently press out the air around the mounds with wet fingers to keep the dough from cracking. Spray the zigzag side of the mold again and sprinkle the top of the ravioli with flour. Invert the press on the cookies, making another impression in the dough, and press very firmly to seal the 2 layers together and cut off excess dough. 

To remove the mold, gently lift by pressing downward on the 2 mounds on the end. Lift up on the mold working your way across the dough slab. Use a dry pastry brush to brush off excess flour. Cut ravioli into individual portions, trimming away excess dough with a knife or fluted pastry cutter. Arrange on a baking sheet. Chill the molded ravioli in the refrigerator until firm to the touch, 30 more minutes. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 

Bake the ravioli for 25 to 30 Minutes. Remove from oven and let sit on cookie sheet 5 more minutes, using a pastry cutter to cut in between the ravioli while warm, if desired. Then slide the slab onto a cookie sheet to cool. Eat 1 slab and freeze the other to keep it really fresh. Yummmmm!!!! ',NULL,'1 hour','(

For the crust: Process the chocolate wafers in a food processor with the butter, sugar, coffee, and salt until fine. Evenly press the crust into the prepared dish covering the bottom completely. Bake until the crust sets, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the filling: Put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl; heat at 75 percent power until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir, and continue to microwave until completely melted, up to 2 minutes more. (Alternatively put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water, and stir occasionally until melted and smooth.)

Blend the cream cheese, sugar, and sour cream together in the food processor until smooth. Scrape down the sides, as needed. Add the eggs and pulse until just incorporated. With the food processor running, pour the chocolate into the wet ingredients and mix until smooth.

Pour the filling evenly over the crust. Bake until filling puffs slightly around the edges, but is still a bit wobbly in the center, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack.

For the Glaze: Put the chocolate, butter and corn syrup in microwave safe bowl. Heat glaze in the microwave at 75 percent power until melted, about 2 minutes. Stir the ingredients together until smooth; add the sour cream. Spread glaze evenly over the warm cake and scatter the crushed candy canes over top. Cool completely, then refrigerate overnight.

Cut into small bars or squares. Serve chilled or room temperature.

For the Crust: 
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. 
In bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade, process cookies with 15 one-second pulses, then let machine run until crumbs are uniformly fine, about 15 seconds. (Alternatively, place cookies in large zipper-lock plastic bag and crush with rolling pin.) 
Transfer crumbs to medium bowl, drizzle with butter, and use fingers to combine until butter is evenly distributed.
Pour crumbs into 9-inch Pyrex pie plate. 
Press crumbs evenly onto bottom and up sides of pie plate. 
Refrigerate lined pie plate 20 minutes to firm crumbs, then bake until crumbs are fragrant and set, about 10 minutes. 
Cool on wire rack while preparing filling.

For the Filling: 
Bring half-and-half, salt, and about 3 tablespoons sugar to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with wooden spoon to dissolve sugar. 
Stir together remaining sugar and cornstarch in small bowl, then sprinkle over yolks and whisk, scraping down sides of bowl, if necessary, until mixture is glossy and sugar has begun to dissolve, about 1 minute. 
Whisk yolks thoroughly in medium bowl until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. 
When half-and-half reaches full simmer, drizzle about 1/2 cup hot half-and-half over yolks, whisking constantly to temper; then whisk egg yolk mixture into simmering half-and-half (mixture should thicken in about 30 seconds). Return to simmer, whisking constantly, until 3 or 4 bubbles burst on the surface and mixture is thickened and glossy, about 15 seconds longer.

Off heat, whisk in butter until incorporated; add chocolates and whisk until melted, scraping pan bottom with rubber spatula to fully incorporate. 
Stir in vanilla, then immediately pour filling into baked and cooled crust. 
Press plastic wrap directly on surface of filling and refrigerate pie until filling is cold and firm, about 3 hours.

For the Topping: 
Just before serving, beat cream, sugar, and vanilla in bowl of standing mixer on low speed until small bubbles form, about 30 seconds. 
Increase speed to medium; continue beating until beaters leave a trail, about 30 seconds more. Increase speed to high; continue beating until cream is smooth, thick, and nearly doubled in volume and forms soft peaks, about 20 seconds. 
Spread or pipe whipped cream over chilled pie filling. 
Cut pie into wedges and serve.

Then add the sugar, eggs, and milk and blend with a paddle attachment. Add half the flour, salt, and shortening and blend well. Add the remaining flour and continue mixing to form a dough. Place the dough on a flour work surface and form into a ball. Place the dough in a greased bowl, and cover with plastic wrap then refrigerate overnight.

The next day, punch down the dough on a work surface, then cover it with a damp towel, and let it rest for 15 minutes. Then roll the dough into a rectangle 1/4-inch thick. With a pizza cutter, cut into 2-inch squares.

Heat some oil for deep fat frying to 365 degrees F. Drop in the beignets, 3 or 4 at a time, and fry on both sides until golden brown. They will look like pillows. Drain them on a brown paper bag and dust extremely heavily with powdered sugar.

Notes about the recipe: These are sold everywhere in New Orleans, even at the airport with the powdered sugar in their white oil stained paper sack or the option of a bag of powdered sugar separate. Probably the most famous place for these is Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans. I went there this year and thought 2 would be enough, but they''re so light I was still craving them after the third one. You eat them traditionally with steaming cups of cafe au lait and the coffee is brewed with chickory sometimes called Creole Coffee. Coffee is brewed with roasted chickory, the root of the leafy salad green, to extend and give body and aroma to the coffee. To make cafe au lait, warm milk in a saucepan and pour 1/3 milk and 2/3 coffee into your cup. Some places throw their beignet dough scraps into the mix for the next batch of dough, almost like a sour dough starter or levand.',NULL,'8 minutes','(

Squeeze and strain juice through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer. Discard the ginger pulp. Reserve the juice.

Sift the flour, baking soda, salt and spices into a medium bowl, then whisk in the pepper; set aside.

Cream the butter and sugar with a handheld mixer until light and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the molasses and ginger juice and beat until evenly incorporated, about 2 minutes. (Stir together with a spatula if needed.) Gradually blend the dry ingredients on low speed into the butter mixture until you have a crumbly mixture. Bring the dough together by hand pressing and kneading lightly until moist, but not tacky. Divide into 2 equal portions, press into disks about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Position racks evenly in the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Dust the dough and a work surface with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out cookies into desired shapes. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake until the cookies are a rich tawny brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on a rack.

For decorating: Whisk the water and egg white powder in a medium bowl until foamy and smooth. Gradually whisk in the confectioners'' sugar to make a smooth icing. For multiple colors divide the icing into batches and add a food coloring as desired. Spread or pipe the icing onto the cookies. Finish with sprinkles, or candies. Let rest on a rack until the icing sets, about 30 minutes.

Cook''s Note: For a chewier cookie, roll them 1/3 to 1/2-inch thick and bake for 16 to 20 minutes.

<font face="" size="">1. If you don’t have a pressure cooker, the chicken can be place in casserole or saucepan with a tight fitting lid and cooked over medium heat for 1-1.25 hours.</font><br>

<font face="" size=""></font><br>

<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">3. Use good quality couscous; Place 2 cups of couscous in a heavy bowl, boil 2 ½ cups of water and add to the couscous and add ½ a teaspoon of salt. Stir with a fork, cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff up with a fork; the grains of couscous will have absorbed the liquid without becoming mushy.</font>

<font face="" size="">TIP: Making fried rice really involves a high heat and lots of tossing of the rice so it doesn’t clump up or stick to the pan. So have all your ingredients ready because it should all move pretty fast and furious. The positive side is your fried rice is a quick meal to fix! (Another reason not to cook things to long is the lettuce lets out moisture when cooked too long. That’s why you add it at the end.)</font><br>

<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">WHY LEFTOVERS: Using rice that’s been in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours helps in making fried rice because the rice won’t cook up as mushy. The time in the frig actually helps harden it to be able to sustain the stir-frying in the wok. So never use freshly cooked rice because it’ll tend to clump and stick together more.</font>

<font face="" size="">Step 1</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">When making sausages, you can either make your own mince or buy it. Making your own gives you control over the amount of fat the sausages contain. If you decide to make your own mince, it is important to use a cut of meat that has some fat - chuck steak is ideal. Fat adds flavour and helps ensure the sausages are tender and moist. If you decide to buy ready-made mince, look for a regular grade with some fat as lean mince does not contain enough fat for sausages. The easiest way to make your own mince is in the food processor. Use a small sharp knife to remove any sinew from the meat. Cut into 2.5cm even-sized pieces to ensure it minces evenly. Place enough meat in the bowl of a food processor to cover the base (about one-third of the quantity for a large processor). Use the pulse button or process in short bursts until the meat is coarsely minced. If you process too much meat at one time, the meat will mince unevenly. Repeat with remaining meat.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Step 2</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Place the mince, breadcrumbs or rusks, parsley, eschalots or onion, garlic, salt and pepper in a large ceramic, stainless steel or glass bowl. You can use either breadcrumbs or rusks. Breadcrumbs give a slightly lighter and more tender result, but rusks are good if you are looking for a yeast-free option. The salt is important as it will bring out the flavours in the sausages. Use clean hands to mix until evenly combined. Divide mixture in half and place each portion into a bowl. Cover and place in fridge until required.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Step 3</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Casings come either packed in salt or rinsed. Either way, it is a good idea to soak them to make them easier to fill. To soak, place in a bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside for 1 hour. Use your fingertips to find the opening at the end of a casing and run cold water all the way through, removing any excess salt. Check for any holes and cut the casing where they occur. Repeat with remaining casing.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Step 4</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Place a large (about 1.6cm diameter) round plastic piping nozzle (as used for cake decorating, such as Loyal brand, available at kitchenware stores) into a clean large piping bag (metal nozzles can tear casing). Open one end of the casing and gently slide it over the end of the piping nozzle. Hold the trailing portion of the casing in one hand and use the thumb and forefinger of your other hand to gently push all the casing on to the nozzle, leaving about 5cm loose at the end. Once you''ve mastered this technique, it is quite easy.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Step 5</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Place a wire rack over a baking tray. Place one-quarter of one portion of the mince mixture into the piping bag. (Too much filling in the bag will make it difficult to manage.) Twist the top of the piping bag. Hold the piping bag in one hand and use the other hand to hold the casing on the nozzle. Gently squeeze the piping bag to slowly fill about 2-3cm of the casing with the mince mixture. Carefully push any air out of the casing and tie a knot in the end below the filling. Continue filling the casing with the mixture in the piping bag, slowly releasing the casing. Refill the piping bag with the mince mixture and continue until the casing is full. (Be careful not to overfill the casing or it will break when you twist into links.) Don''t worry if air pockets form as most of these will be removed. When you have finished filling the casing, gently ease any remaining casing off the nozzle. Use your fingers to carefully redistribute the filling in any uneven spots, so the sausage is an even thickness. Push any air out of the end of the casing and tie a knot. Lay the sausage out flat and use a small pin to prick any remaining air bubbles and gently press out any air. Place in the fridge. Repeat with the remaining casing and mince mixture.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Step 6</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">To twist the filled casings into links, start at one end of the sausage and twist at 12cm intervals into shorter lengths. Repeat with the remaining sausage. Place on a wire rack in the fridge, uncovered, overnight to allow the skin to dry out. The sausages are then ready to cook. Store in the fridge or freezer (see instructions over page).</font>

<font face="" size="">ROASTING INSTRUCTIONS</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">1. Set the oven temperature no lower than 325 °F. Preheating is not necessary.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">2. Be sure the turkey is completely thawed. Times are based on fresh or thawed birds at a refrigerator temperature of 40 °F or below.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">3. Place turkey breast-side up on a flat wire rack in a shallow roasting pan 2 to 2 1/2 inches deep.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Optional steps:</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Tuck wing tips back under shoulders of bird (called "akimbo").</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">Add one-half cup water to the bottom of the pan.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">In the beginning, a tent of aluminum foil may be placed loosely over the breast of the turkey for the first 1 to 1 1/2 hours, then removed for browning. Or, a tent of foil may be placed over the turkey after the turkey has reached the desired golden brown color.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">4. For optimum safety, cook stuffing in a casserole. If stuffing your turkey, mix ingredients just before stuffing it; stuff loosely. Additional time is required for the turkey and stuffing to reach a safe minimum internal temperature (see chart).</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">5. For safety and doneness, the internal temperature should be checked with a food thermometer. The temperature of the turkey and the center of the stuffing must reach a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 °F. Check the temperature in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast.</font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size=""></font><br>
<font face="" size="">6. Let the bird stand 20 minutes before removing stuffing and carving.</font><br>
